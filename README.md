# NonBlockingRestService

Sample study implementation for a rest services using reactive library. The idea is to create a rest service that is non-blocking, in this way we will have a better
resource utilisation.

In this example I wille rxScala, that is scala wrapper around RxJava developed by netflix.

```https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxScala```

The spring boot will be use for packaging/running the application.
